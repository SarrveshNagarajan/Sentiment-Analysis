# Sentiment-Analysis

This is a Sentiment Analysis project using Machine Learning, which predicts the mood of an individual based on their daily activities which includes Sleep duration, Memotion (which is actually the emotion detected from the memes shared through social media : Meme-emotion), and from the Moodie app (which is an existing application which helps in storing and analysis of the moods of an individual). 

Through these three data, We predict the overall mood of an individual with the help of Machine algorithms like Random forest and Decison tree. We have used a module called Vader Sentiment, which has the inbuilt functions which helps in finding out the sentiment of a given text.

This helps an individual to keep track of the status of their mental health, improving their mental well-being by doing certain constructive activities and this also helps in therapeutic processes of an individual.

All the necessary datasets are uploaded in the DATASETS file.
